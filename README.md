This app is a timer/clockwatch which keeps track of activity in a SQLite database.

Enter a number according to the prompt depending on what you want to do. You can
enter both a task and a subtask by separating them with a space or anything not
alphanumeric.

The stats part of the app is still minimal and returns the activity of the day with
their streak, and general stats with number of timers and total time for a day,
a week or the year.
